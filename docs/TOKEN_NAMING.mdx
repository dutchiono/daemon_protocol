# Token Naming Clarification

## DAEMON Token = Base Token

**They are the SAME token** - just different naming conventions:

- **`DAEMON_TOKEN_ADDRESS`** (environment variable) = The DAEMON protocol token
- **`baseToken`** (contract variable) = The same DAEMON token
- **"Base Token"** (documentation term) = The same DAEMON token

## Why the Confusion?

1. **In Contracts**: The variable is called `baseToken` because it's the "base" token that all other tokens pair with
2. **In Environment**: We use `DAEMON_TOKEN_ADDRESS` for clarity (it's the DAEMON token)
3. **In Documentation**: Sometimes called "Base Token" to explain its role

## The Token's Role

The DAEMON token is the "base token" because:
- All new tokens deployed via DaemonFactory pair with DAEMON
- New tokens must have addresses < DAEMON address (ensures token0 ordering)
- DAEMON acts as the base pair token for all launches

## Standardization

**Use `DAEMON_TOKEN_ADDRESS` everywhere**:
- Environment variables: `DAEMON_TOKEN_ADDRESS`
- SDK constants: `DAEMON_TOKEN_ADDRESS`
- Documentation: "DAEMON Token" or "DAEMON token (base token)"

**In contracts**, it's still called `baseToken` because:
- That's the contract variable name (can't change without breaking)
- It clearly indicates its role as the base pairing token

## Summary

- **DAEMON Token** = The protocol's native token
- **Base Token** = Same thing, just describes its role
- **`baseToken`** = Contract variable name for the DAEMON token
- **`DAEMON_TOKEN_ADDRESS`** = Environment variable name (use this)
