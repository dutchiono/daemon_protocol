# Builder Rewards System

## Overview

The Builder Rewards system automatically distributes 5% of all protocol fees to active contributors based on their GitHub contributions.

## How It Works

1. **Fee Collection**: 5% of all swap fees are routed to BuilderRewardDistributor
2. **Contribution Tracking**: GitHub PRs are analyzed and scored
3. **Score Calculation**: Contributions are weighted and decay over time
4. **Daily Distribution**: Rewards are distributed daily based on active scores

## Scoring

### Base Weights

- Code: 10 points (1.0x)
- SDK: 8 points (0.8x)
- Docs: 5 points (0.5x)
- Tests: 3 points (0.3x)
- Bugfix: 15 points (1.5x)
- Feature: 20 points (2.0x)
- Refactor: 7 points (0.7x)

### Decay

- Grace period: 7 days (no decay)
- Decay rate: 5% per day (exponential)
- Minimum floor: 0.1% of original score

## Eligibility
